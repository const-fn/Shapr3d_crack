# Shapr3D 5.860.8843.0 #241a6cc1 | original release

Written from scratch. Made to work dynamically via pattern scanning and intermodular call analysis. (could still be improved) \
**Based on sl4v3k's work.** Put his latest version through my disassembler (ida) to find out what he is patching. \
Technically still somewhat experimental version. (report if any issues occure) \

# Shapr3D 5.880.8980.0 #7cd1f54e | no update needed

License check is not run continuously anymore. \
