Written from scratch. Made to work dynamically via pattern scanning and intermodular call analysis. (could still be improved)
**Based on sl4v3k's work.** Put his latest version through my disassembler (ida) to find out what he is patching.
Technically still somewhat experimental version. (report if any issues occure)
